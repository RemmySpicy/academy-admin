# Academy Admin Code Quality Tools

Comprehensive code quality and security tools specifically designed for the Academy Admin system to enforce program context filtering standards and prevent security vulnerabilities.

## üéØ Overview

These tools ensure that every feature in Academy Admin follows consistent program context filtering patterns, preventing security vulnerabilities and maintaining data isolation between programs.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Included

### 1. Program Context Linter (`program_context_linter.py`)

**Purpose**: Enforces program context filtering standards across all features.

**Checks**:
- Model files have `program_id` foreign key fields
- Service methods accept `program_context` parameter
- Database queries filter by program context
- Schemas include program context fields
- Route handlers use program context dependency injection

**Usage**:
```bash
# Check all backend files
python3 tools/code_quality/program_context_linter.py --check-all

# Check specific file
python3 tools/code_quality/program_context_linter.py backend/app/features/students/services/student_service.py

# Get JSON output
python3 tools/code_quality/program_context_linter.py --check-all --json

# Using npm script
npm run program-context:lint
```

### 2. Security Scanner (`security_scanner.py`)

**Purpose**: Detects security vulnerabilities and program context bypass attempts.

**Checks**:
- Program context bypass vulnerabilities
- SQL injection risks
- Hardcoded secrets and sensitive data
- Unsafe deserialization
- Missing access control
- Privilege escalation risks

**Usage**:
```bash
# Scan all backend files
python3 tools/code_quality/security_scanner.py --scan-all

# Generate JSON report
python3 tools/code_quality/security_scanner.py --scan-all --report-format json

# Save report to file
python3 tools/code_quality/security_scanner.py --scan-all --output reports/security_scan.json

# Using npm script
npm run security:scan
```

### 3. Test Coverage Checker (`test_coverage_checker.py`)

**Purpose**: Ensures adequate test coverage for program context filtering.

**Checks**:
- Service methods have corresponding tests
- Program context filtering tests exist
- Cross-program access prevention tests
- Role-based access control tests

**Usage**:
```bash
# Check test coverage
python3 tools/code_quality/test_coverage_checker.py --check-all

# Generate missing test files
python3 tools/code_quality/test_coverage_checker.py --check-all --generate-missing-tests

# Using npm script
npm run test:coverage:program-context
```

### 4. Comprehensive Quality Checker (`run_all_checks.py`)

**Purpose**: Runs all quality checks in a single command.

**Includes**:
- Program context linting
- Security scanning
- Test coverage checking
- Standard code quality (Black, isort, flake8, ESLint, Prettier)
- Type checking (mypy, TypeScript)
- Dependency vulnerability scanning

**Usage**:
```bash
# Run all checks
python3 tools/code_quality/run_all_checks.py

# Auto-fix issues where possible
python3 tools/code_quality/run_all_checks.py --fix

# Generate detailed reports
python3 tools/code_quality/run_all_checks.py --generate-reports

# CI mode (strict checking)
python3 tools/code_quality/run_all_checks.py --ci

# Using npm scripts
npm run quality:academy
npm run quality:academy:fix
npm run quality:academy:reports
```

### 5. Git Hooks

**Purpose**: Automatic quality checks during development workflow.

**Hooks**:
- **pre-commit**: Runs program context linting and security scanning
- **pre-push**: Runs full quality checks before pushing
- **commit-msg**: Validates commit message format

**Installation**:
```bash
# Install all hooks
./tools/code_quality/install_hooks.sh

# Or install manually
ln -s ../../tools/code_quality/pre_commit_hook.py .git/hooks/pre-commit
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Python dependencies (for security scanner)
pip install safety

# Make tools executable
chmod +x tools/code_quality/*.py
```

### 2. Run Initial Check

```bash
# Check current code quality
npm run quality:academy

# Generate baseline reports
npm run quality:academy:reports
```

### 3. Install Git Hooks

```bash
# Install automated checks
./tools/code_quality/install_hooks.sh
```

### 4. Fix Issues

```bash
# Auto-fix what can be fixed
npm run quality:academy:fix

# Manual fixes for remaining issues
# Follow the suggestions in the reports
```

## üìä Reports and Output

## üö® Common Issues and Solutions

### Program Context Violations

**Issue**: Service method missing `program_context` parameter
**Solution**: Add `program_context: Optional[str] = None` to method signature

**Issue**: Missing database filtering
**Solution**: Add `if program_context: query = query.filter(Model.program_id == program_context)`

**Issue**: Schema missing `program_id` field
**Solution**: Add `program_id: str = Field(..., description="Program ID")`

### Security Violations

**Issue**: Hardcoded secrets detected
**Solution**: Move secrets to environment variables

**Issue**: SQL injection risk
**Solution**: Use parameterized queries or ORM methods

**Issue**: Missing access control
**Solution**: Add authentication and authorization dependencies

### Test Coverage Issues

**Issue**: Missing program context tests
**Solution**: Add tests for program filtering and cross-program access prevention

**Issue**: Incomplete role-based tests
**Solution**: Add tests for different user roles and permissions

## üìà Metrics and Monitoring

### Quality Metrics

- **Program Context Compliance**: Percentage of features with proper filtering
- **Security Vulnerability Count**: Critical/High/Medium/Low severity issues
- **Test Coverage**: Program context filtering test coverage
- **Code Quality Score**: Overall code quality rating
