# Feature Specifications

This directory contains all feature specifications for the Academy Admin system. These files serve as the single source of truth for feature requirements and implementation details.

## Directory Structure

### `/features/`
Contains individual feature specifications. Each feature should have its own file with detailed requirements, user stories, acceptance criteria, and technical specifications.

**Example files:**
- `user-management.md` - User registration, authentication, roles
- `student-enrollment.md` - Student enrollment process and management
- `course-management.md` - Course creation, scheduling, and administration
- `assessment-system.md` - Quizzes, exams, and grading
- `dashboard-analytics.md` - Analytics and reporting features

### `/api/`
Contains API endpoint specifications including request/response schemas, authentication requirements, and error handling.

**Example files:**
- `auth-endpoints.md` - Authentication and authorization APIs
- `student-endpoints.md` - Student management APIs
- `course-endpoints.md` - Course management APIs

### `/database/`
Contains database schema specifications, entity relationships, and migration requirements.

**Example files:**
- `schema-overview.md` - Complete database schema
- `user-models.md` - User-related table structures
- `academic-models.md` - Academic-related table structures

### `/ui/`
Contains UI/UX specifications, wireframes, design requirements, and component specifications.

**Example files:**
- `design-system.md` - Design tokens, colors, typography
- `dashboard-layout.md` - Dashboard wireframes and components
- `forms-specification.md` - Form designs and validation rules

## Template Structure

Each feature specification should follow this template:

```markdown
# Feature Name

## How to Use

1. **Creating New Features**: Add new specification files to the appropriate directory
2. **Referencing During Development**: Claude will reference these files when implementing features
3. **Updating Specifications**: Keep specifications updated as requirements change
4. **Review Process**: Ensure specifications are reviewed before implementation begins

## Best Practices

- Use clear, concise language
- Include visual mockups or diagrams when helpful
- Specify both happy path and error scenarios
- Include performance and security considerations
- Link related specifications together
- Keep specifications up-to-date with implementation changes
