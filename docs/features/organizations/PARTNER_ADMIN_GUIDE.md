```http
POST /api/v1/partner-auth/login
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "username": "techcorp.admin",
  "password": "secure_password"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs...",
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "organization_id": "org-123",
  "permissions": ["manage_students", "view_payments", "generate_reports"]
}
```

### 3. API Usage Examples

#### Get Sponsored Students
```javascript
const response = await fetch('/api/v1/partner/students', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
});

const students = await response.json();
```

#### Generate Monthly Report
```javascript
const reportData = await fetch('/api/v1/partner/reports/monthly', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    month: '2025-07',
    include_details: true,
    format: 'json'
  })
});
```

### 4. Rate Limits and Security

#### API Rate Limits
- **Standard Endpoints**: 100 requests per minute
- **Report Generation**: 10 requests per hour
- **Bulk Operations**: 5 requests per minute

#### Security Best Practices
- Store API tokens securely
- Use HTTPS for all API calls
- Implement proper error handling
- Log API usage for auditing
- Rotate tokens regularly

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Cannot Access Student Information
**Cause**: Student not sponsored by your organization or permissions issue
**Solution**: Verify student sponsorship status and check user permissions

#### 2. Payment Not Processing
**Cause**: Budget limits exceeded or payment method issues
**Solution**: Check budget settings and update payment information

#### 3. Reports Not Generating
**Cause**: Insufficient data or date range issues
**Solution**: Adjust date range and verify data availability

#### 4. API Authentication Failures
**Cause**: Expired tokens or incorrect credentials
**Solution**: Re-authenticate and obtain new access token
