```javascript
const sampleCourseHierarchy = [
  {
    id: 'course-1',
    name: 'Swimming Course',
    code: 'SWIM-101',
    curricula: [
      {
        id: 'curriculum-1',
        name: 'Beginner Swimming',
        levels: [
          {
            id: 'level-1',
            name: 'Level 1 - Water Introduction',
            modules: [
              {
                id: 'module-1',
                name: 'Water Safety',
                sections: [
                  { id: 'section-1', name: 'Pool Rules' },
                  { id: 'section-2', name: 'Safety Equipment' }
                ]
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
];
```

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Lesson
```typescript
const lessonData = {
  title: 'Water Safety Basics',
  code: 'SWIM-SAFETY-001',
  description: 'Introduction to basic water safety principles',
  instructor_guide: 'Focus on demonstration and hands-on practice',
  lesson_types: ['practical', 'interactive'],
  resource_links: [
    {
      title: 'Safety Video',
      url: 'https://example.com/safety-video',
      type: 'video'
    }
  ],
  duration_minutes: 45,
  difficulty_level: 'beginner',
  is_required: true
};
```

### Creating an Assessment
```typescript
const assessmentData = {
  title: 'Water Safety Knowledge Check',
  code: 'SWIM-ASSESS-001',
  description: 'Assessment of water safety knowledge',
  assessment_guide: 'Use 3-star system: 1=needs improvement, 2=satisfactory, 3=excellent',
  assessment_type: 'practical',
  assessment_items: [
    {
      title: 'Pool Entry Safety',
      description: 'Demonstrate safe pool entry techniques',
      sequence: 1
    }
  ],
  difficulty_level: 'beginner',
  is_required: true
};
```

## Best Practices

### Content Creation
1. **Use Descriptive Titles**: Make titles clear and searchable
2. **Include Instructor Guides**: Provide detailed guidance for instructors
3. **Organize Resource Links**: Categorize resources by type for easy access
4. **Set Appropriate Difficulty**: Match difficulty to target audience
5. **Use Hierarchical Assignments**: Assign content to appropriate curriculum levels

### Assignment Management
1. **Review Existing Assignments**: Check for duplicates before adding new assignments
2. **Use Visual Feedback**: Leverage breadcrumb navigation for clarity
3. **Test Assignment Paths**: Verify assignment hierarchy makes logical sense
4. **Document Assignment Rationale**: Include notes on why content is assigned to specific locations

### Database Considerations
1. **Use JSON Fields**: Store structured data like resource links and assessment items in JSON
2. **Maintain Referential Integrity**: Ensure all assignments reference valid curriculum components
3. **Index Search Fields**: Optimize database queries for search functionality
4. **Regular Cleanup**: Remove orphaned assignments and unused content

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Assignment Section Not Showing**: Ensure `courseHierarchy` prop is not empty
2. **TypeScript Errors**: Check for HTML entities in JSX (use `â†’` instead of `&gt;`)
3. **Form Validation Errors**: Verify required fields are properly marked
4. **Database Migration Issues**: Check enum type consistency between models

### Performance Optimization
1. **Use React.memo**: Optimize component re-renders
2. **Implement Virtual Scrolling**: For large content lists
3. **Cache API Responses**: Use TanStack Query caching effectively
4. **Lazy Load Components**: Load heavy components on demand
