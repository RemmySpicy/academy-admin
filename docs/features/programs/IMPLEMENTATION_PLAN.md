- [ ] Update scheduling endpoints to use program session types
- [ ] Add configuration lookup utilities

### üóÑÔ∏è Phase 3: Database Migration

#### **3.1 Migration Script Creation**
- [ ] Create Alembic migration for new program fields
- [ ] Add column creation with JSON data types
- [ ] Set up proper indexes for JSON field queries
- [ ] Add database constraints where appropriate

#### **3.2 Data Migration**
- [ ] Create migration script to populate existing programs:
  - Apply default age groups (6-8, 9-12, 13-17, 18+)
  - Apply default difficulty levels (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced)
  - Apply default session types (Private, Group, School Group)
  - Set default session duration (60 minutes)
- [ ] Validate migration results
- [ ] Create rollback procedures

#### **3.3 Database Optimization**
- [ ] Add indexes for frequently queried JSON fields
- [ ] Optimize configuration queries
- [ ] Set up monitoring for new field usage

### üîó Phase 4: Feature Integration Updates

#### **4.1 Course Creation Integration**
- [ ] Update course creation forms to use program difficulty levels
- [ ] Add age group targeting in course configuration
- [ ] Update course validation against program configuration
- [ ] Test course creation with new program configurations

#### **4.2 Curriculum Builder Integration**
- [ ] Update curriculum level creation to assign difficulty levels

## Implementation Checklist

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Review enhanced program setup specification
- [ ] Understand existing program management implementation
- [ ] Review feature integration requirements
- [ ] Set up development environment

### Quality Assurance
- [ ] Unit tests for all new components
- [ ] Integration tests for API endpoints
- [ ] End-to-end tests for user workflows
- [ ] Performance testing with realistic data volumes
- [ ] Security testing for program context validation

### Deployment Preparation
- [ ] Database migration testing
- [ ] Backup procedures for existing program data
- [ ] Rollback procedures for migration issues
- [ ] Production deployment checklist
- [ ] User notification of new features

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Risks
1. **Data Migration Issues**: Existing programs lose data or become unusable
2. **Integration Breaks**: Dependent features stop working with new configuration
3. **Performance Impact**: New JSON fields slow down queries
4. **User Adoption**: Complex interface overwhelms users

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Comprehensive Testing**: Thorough testing at each phase
2. **Gradual Rollout**: Feature flags for gradual feature enablement
3. **Backup Strategy**: Complete data backups before migration
4. **User Training**: Documentation and training materials
5. **Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring of system performance and errors

## Success Criteria

### Technical Success
