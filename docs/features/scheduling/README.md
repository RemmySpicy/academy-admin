## 🎨 Frontend Components

### FacilityScheduleManager

The main scheduling interface component that provides:

- Facility selection with overview cards
- Session filtering and search
- Real-time statistics (today's sessions, active sessions, participants, utilization)
- Session list with inline actions
- Calendar view (placeholder for future implementation)

```typescript
import { FacilityScheduleManager } from '@/features/scheduling/components/FacilityScheduleManager';

function SchedulingPage() {
  const [selectedFacility, setSelectedFacility] = useState<string>('');
  
  return (
    <FacilityScheduleManager
      selectedFacilityId={selectedFacility}
      onSelectFacility={setSelectedFacility}
    />
  );
}
```

### StudentScheduleManager

Student-focused schedule view that shows:

- Student's upcoming sessions
- Course enrollments
- Progress tracking
- Attendance history

```typescript
import { StudentScheduleManager } from '@/features/scheduling/components/StudentScheduleManager';

function StudentPage({ studentId }: { studentId: string }) {
  return (
    <StudentScheduleManager 
      studentId={studentId}
      enrollments={studentEnrollments}
      isLoading={loading}
    />
  );
}
```

## 🎯 User Experience
