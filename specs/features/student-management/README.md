## Business Rules

### Student Profile Management
1. **Unique Identity**
   - Each student must have a unique email address
   - Student ID is auto-generated and immutable
   - Full name and date of birth are required for enrollment

2. **Profile Completeness**
   - Basic information (name, email, phone, DOB, address) required for enrollment
   - Emergency contact information required before first session
   - Medical information and waivers required for certain programs

3. **Academic Assignment**
   - Each student must be assigned to at least one program
   - Students can be enrolled in multiple courses simultaneously
   - Curriculum level assignment is automatic based on assessment results

### Parent-Child Relationships
1. **Family Structure**
   - One parent/guardian can manage multiple students
   - Each student has exactly one primary parent/guardian account
   - Secondary guardians can be added with limited permissions

2. **Financial Responsibility**
   - Parent account consolidates all financial obligations for their children
   - Session credits are tracked per child but billed to parent
   - Payment status affects all children under the parent account

3. **Communication**
   - All official communications go to the primary parent
   - Parents receive notifications for all their children
   - Emergency contacts are maintained per student

### Enrollment Workflows
1. **Course Enrollment**
   - Students must meet age and skill prerequisites
   - Enrollment capacity limits enforced (5 for group, 2 for private)
   - Instructor assignment required before first session

2. **Waitlist Management**
   - Students added to waitlist when courses are full
   - Automatic enrollment when spots become available
   - Waitlist priority based on enrollment date

3. **Transfer and Withdrawal**
   - Students can transfer between courses with admin approval
   - Session credits transfer with the student
   - Withdrawal requires parent confirmation and financial settlement

### Progress Tracking
1. **Assessment System**
   - 0-3 star rating system for all skill areas
   - Progress tracked at module and section levels
   - Automatic level advancement based on assessment criteria

2. **Attendance Requirements**
   - Minimum attendance required for level advancement
   - Missed sessions affect progress tracking
   - Makeup sessions available with instructor approval
