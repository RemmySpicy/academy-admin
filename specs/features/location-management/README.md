# Location Management Feature Specification

## Feature Overview

The location management system provides comprehensive multi-location support for the Academy Management System, enabling facility-specific operations with consolidated oversight. This feature allows the academy to manage multiple physical locations with facility-specific data segregation while maintaining centralized administrative control and cross-location visibility.

## User Stories

### Super Admin
- As a Super Admin, I can create and manage multiple academy locations/facilities
- As a Super Admin, I can assign specific programs to each location
- As a Super Admin, I can view consolidated data across all locations
- As a Super Admin, I can transfer students between locations
- As a Super Admin, I can assign instructors to specific locations
- As a Super Admin, I can configure location-specific settings and capacity limits
- As a Super Admin, I can generate reports across all locations or for specific facilities

### Program Admin
- As a Program Admin, I can switch between assigned locations using a location switcher
- As a Program Admin, I can view only students and data for my assigned locations
- As a Program Admin, I can manage schedules and bookings for my assigned locations
- As a Program Admin, I can request student transfers between locations (if authorized)
- As a Program Admin, I can access location-specific reports and analytics
- As a Program Admin, I can manage instructors assigned to my locations

### System Operations
- As a system, I must segregate data by location while maintaining referential integrity
- As a system, I must prevent scheduling conflicts across locations
- As a system, I must maintain audit trails for all location-based operations
- As a system, I must support location-specific business rules and constraints

## Business Rules

### Location Hierarchy
1. **Academy Level** - Central organization
   - Contains multiple locations
   - Consolidated reporting and oversight
   - Cross-location student transfers
   - Global program management

2. **Location Level** - Individual facilities
   - Facility-specific operations
   - Location-specific capacity limits
   - Facility-specific instructor assignments
   - Location-specific scheduling

### Data Segregation Rules
- Students are assigned to a primary location
- Instructors can be assigned to multiple locations
- Schedules are location-specific
- Programs can be offered at multiple locations
- Payments are tracked per student regardless of location

### Transfer Rules
- Students can be transferred between locations
- Transfer requires Super Admin approval or authorized Program Admin
- Transfer history is maintained for audit purposes
- Active schedules are handled during transfers (cancelled or transferred)
- Student progression and assessment data transfers with the student

### Capacity Management
- Each location has configurable capacity limits
- Capacity applies to concurrent sessions, not total enrollment
- Location-specific room/facility management
- Equipment availability per location

## Technical Requirements
