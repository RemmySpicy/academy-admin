# Authentication Feature Specification

## Feature Overview

The authentication system provides secure access control for the Academy Management System with role-based permissions. It serves as the foundation for all other features by managing user identity, authorization, and security.

## User Stories

### Super Admin
- As a Super Admin, I can log in with email and password to access the system
- As a Super Admin, I can create and manage Program Admin accounts
- As a Super Admin, I can assign Program Admins to multiple programs
- As a Super Admin, I can override any system restrictions when needed
- As a Super Admin, I can view and manage all system data across all programs

### Program Admin
- As a Program Admin, I can log in with email and password to access assigned programs
- As a Program Admin, I can only access data for programs I'm assigned to
- As a Program Admin, I can manage students, instructors, and schedules within my assigned programs
- As a Program Admin, I cannot access Super Admin functions

### System Security
- As a system, I must securely authenticate all users before granting access
- As a system, I must enforce role-based permissions for all actions
- As a system, I must maintain secure session management
- As a system, I must provide secure password handling and storage

## Business Rules

### Role Hierarchy
1. **Super Admin** - Complete system access
   - Can create/edit/delete any data
   - Can manage all programs and locations
   - Can create and manage Program Admin accounts
   - Can override system restrictions
   - Full audit trail access

2. **Program Admin** - Program-specific access
   - Can only access assigned programs
   - Can manage students, instructors, curriculum, and schedules for assigned programs
   - Cannot access other programs' data
   - Cannot create other admin accounts
   - Cannot override system restrictions

### Authentication Rules
- Email/password authentication only
- Password must meet security requirements (minimum 8 characters, mixed case, numbers, special characters)
- Account lockout after 5 failed login attempts
- Session timeout after 8 hours of inactivity
- Secure password reset via email

### Authorization Rules
- All API endpoints require valid JWT token
- Role-based access control enforced at API level
- Program-specific data access controlled by user assignments
- Audit logging for all admin actions

## Technical Requirements

### Authentication Flow
1. User submits email/password
2. System validates credentials against database
3. System generates JWT token with user role and program assignments
4. Token returned to client for subsequent requests
5. Token validated on each API request

### Security Requirements
- Passwords hashed using bcrypt with salt
- JWT tokens signed with secure secret key
- HTTPS required for all authentication endpoints
- Rate limiting on login attempts
- Secure session management

### Database Schema Requirements
- Users table with role and program assignments
- Password reset tokens table
- Session management table
- Audit log table for authentication events

## API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /api/v1/auth/login` - User login
- `POST /api/v1/auth/logout` - User logout
- `POST /api/v1/auth/refresh` - Token refresh
- `POST /api/v1/auth/forgot-password` - Password reset request
- `POST /api/v1/auth/reset-password` - Password reset completion

### User Management (Super Admin only)
- `GET /api/v1/users` - List all users
- `POST /api/v1/users` - Create new user
- `GET /api/v1/users/{id}` - Get user details
- `PUT /api/v1/users/{id}` - Update user
- `DELETE /api/v1/users/{id}` - Delete user
- `POST /api/v1/users/{id}/programs` - Assign programs to user

### Profile Management
- `GET /api/v1/auth/profile` - Get current user profile
- `PUT /api/v1/auth/profile` - Update current user profile
- `POST /api/v1/auth/change-password` - Change password

## Database Schema

### Users Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    first_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    role VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'program_admin',
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### User Program Assignments Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE user_program_assignments (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    program_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES programs(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    UNIQUE(user_id, program_id)
);
```

### Password Reset Tokens Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE password_reset_tokens (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    token VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    expires_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    used_at TIMESTAMP NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Authentication Audit Log Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE auth_audit_log (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
    action VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    ip_address INET,
    user_agent TEXT,
    success BOOLEAN NOT NULL,
    details JSONB,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```
